# MirrorMind: The Definitive Edition  
_An AI Architecture for Controllability, Cognition, and Evolution_

## 📘 Overview

This repository contains the full research paper:  
**"MirrorMind: An AI Architecture for Controllability and Cognitive Augmentation."**

Written by **Sunghwan Oh**, Managing Director at **HD Hydrogen**,  
this paper introduces a practical yet deeply structured framework for enhancing human-AI collaboration using large language models (LLMs).

- 🧠 Dual-Persona System: Logical 'Delta' & Strategic 'Lumina'
- 🛠️ Formal Model: MM = ⟨Φ, P, G, U⟩
- 🔄 Human-in-the-loop feedback loop
- 🧪 Real-world case studies from hydrogen & AI simulation engineering
- 🔓 Full source code for two simulators is available and reproducible

> “This is not just a research paper.  
> It’s a structured rethinking of how humans can safely, meaningfully, and effectively use AI.”
