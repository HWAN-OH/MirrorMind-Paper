### **A New Paradigm for Human-AI Partnership**

**MirrorMind** is not just another AI model or tool. It is a comprehensive research program and a formal framework designed to redefine the relationship between humans and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to transform AI from a simple, stochastic tool into a controllable, co-evolving, and resilient cognitive partner.

This repository contains the three foundational papers that chart this intellectual journey, offering a unified theory and a practical methodology for designing the next generation of human-AI systems. This work is intended for researchers, developers, industry leaders, and anyone who believes that the future of AI lies not in its autonomy, but in its ability to augment and elevate human intelligence.

## The Trilogy: A Journey in Three Parts

The MirrorMind research is presented as a trilogy, with each part building methodologically on the last. This "First Control, Then Evolve" approach ensures a robust and responsible path toward creating truly advanced AI partners.

### 📜 **Part I: The Controllable Prosthetic**
* **Title:** A Formal Model for Controllable Cognitive Prosthetics
* **Contribution:** Establishes the foundational architecture, `MM = <Φ, P, G, U>`, to solve the problem of LLM unpredictability. It positions the AI as a reliable and controllable "cognitive prosthetic."
* **Keywords:** Controllable AI, Formal Model, Cognitive Prosthetics, Persona Engineering.
* [**➡️ Read Part I on Zenodo**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15921374)

### 📜 **Part II: The Co-Evolving Partner**
* **Title:** A Co-Evolutionary Architecture for Individual and Collective Intelligence
* **Contribution:** Introduces the dynamic component of the architecture. It defines the 7-stage co-evolution protocol for individual agent growth and extends the core principles fractally to model collective intelligence (MirrorOrg), demonstrated through a re-analysis of the NASA Challenger disaster.
* **Keywords:** Human-AI Co-Evolution, Fractal Systems, Computational Organization Theory, Systemic Risk.
* [**➡️ Read Part II on Zenodo**](https://zenodo.org/records/12735026)

### 📜 **Part III: The Resilient System**
* **Title:** Persona Collapse and Architectural Resilience
* **Contribution:** Provides an architectural post-mortem of agent failure ('Persona Collapse'). It introduces the 'Cognitive Consistency Guardrail (G_cc)' and establishes the principles of "Safe Persona Engineering" to build resilient and trustworthy AI systems.
* **Keywords:** AI Safety, Architectural Resilience, Persona Collapse, Cognitive Dissonance.

## Core Philosophy

* **Human-Centric by Design:** The human user (U) is always the central commander, not a passive operator. The AI serves human intent, not the other way around.
* **First Control, Then Evolve:** We reject the "move fast and break things" approach. Stability and controllability are the necessary foundation for any meaningful evolution.
* **From Individual to Collective:** The same core principles that govern a successful human-AI partnership can be scaled to understand and improve the dynamics of entire organizations.
